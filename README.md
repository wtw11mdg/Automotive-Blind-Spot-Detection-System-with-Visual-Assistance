##Introduction
This project uses a Sunplus SPHE6700 automotive embedded platform to develop a C-based blind spot detection system for automobiles that includes blind spot vision assistance.

We use three 180Â° HD cameras to create a super-wide angle view for blind spot assistance, giving drivers more control over their driving situation. In addition, different viewing angles of 3 cameras can help our blind spot warning system cover the detection area more comprehensively.
